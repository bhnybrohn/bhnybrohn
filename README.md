a software developer more vested in backend development with strong analytical skills and proficiency in mathematics, looking to advance a promising career in the position of software developer at technological companies and involved
in things greater than oneself. not a business or commercial student but I think am a good business guy who always tries to make each product I build marketable.  loves nice design, In as much as I love good design am an advocate of good coding practice. I write clean, well-structured code that is readable, maintainable, scale-able, and friendly.

Oh, about journey, i am mostly self-taught and as a person who is always determined about getting better in whatever he does. I have always tried to improve myself over the years by learning new technologies and also trying to be better at the previously existing ones.
